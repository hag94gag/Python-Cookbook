# Python Cookbook

Welcome to my personal Python Cookbook!

This repository is a collection of Python code snippets, exercises and notes that I have curated throughout my learning journey. It is a compilation of examples from a variety of sources, including:

- YouTube tutorials
- Books
- Websites
- And more!

### Purpose

The primary goal of this Python Cookbook is to serve as a refresher for myself. I hope that others find it useful too, whether you're just starting with Python or looking for quick reference material.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or adapt the content to suit your needs. Happy coding!
